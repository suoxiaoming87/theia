# @theia/core re-exports

In order to make application builds more stable `@theia/core` re-exports some common dependencies
for Theia extensions to re-use.

## Usage example

Let's take inversify as an example since you will most likely use this package, you can import this
package by prefixing with `@theia/core/shared/`:

```ts
import { injectable } from '@theia/core/shared/inversify';

@injectable()
export class SomeClass {
    // ...
}
```
